# Gabriel Elepaño - Personal Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. The site is designed to showcase my projects in software development and data analytics through an interactive, responsive user interface.

## 🚀 Technical Overview

The website is a static site built with standard web technologies, featuring custom page transitions and scroll-based animations.

### Technologies Used
* **Core:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Frameworks & Libraries:** * **Bootstrap 5** (Layout and Responsive Design)
    * **GSAP & ScrollTrigger** (High-performance animations)
    * **FontAwesome & Bootstrap Icons** (Iconography)

## 📂 Project Structure

* `index.html`: The main landing page containing the Home, Skills, About, and Contact sections.
* `*-project.html`: Dedicated detail pages for individual projects (e.g., `asr-project.html`, `stock-project.html`).
* `css/`: Contains global styles (`styles.css`) and project-specific layout files (`projects-styles.css`).
* `js/`: Scripts for logic (`app.js`), DOM manipulation (`scripts.js`), and page transitions (`transition.js`).
* `img/`: Stores project screenshots, icons, and assets.

## 📦 How to Run

Since this is a static website, no build process or backend server is required.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Open `index.html`** in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).

*Note: For the best experience with transitions, it is recommended to view the site using a local development server (e.g., VS Code Live Server).*
